# pseudo_uniform_generator
This code is a pseudo random number generator. These numbers follow a uniform distribution.
This code is a uniform random number generator, which uses uses the linear congruential generator 
and the Lagged-Fibonacci generator (LFG) algorithms to produce an array of random numbers (U(0,1)) 
in the unit interval [0,1]. It also includes a histogram generator for examining the distribution 
of the generated numbers. It calculates the sample mean and the sample variance of these numbers as well.
